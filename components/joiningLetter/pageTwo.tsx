              He is directed to report to the Principal, Zonal Railway Training
              Institute, {data.divionalManagerCity}, to undergo the initial
              training scheduled to be held on {data.trainingDate}. He will be
              eligible for a stipend of {data.stipend} under the rules in force
              from the date of joining at the {data.trainingInstitute}.
              <br />
              <br />
              On successful completion of the training, he will be absorbed
              against a working post in the pay scale of {data.payScale} plus
              all allowances as admissible. He will be on probation for a period
              of two years from the date of absorption against the working post.
              He must undergo the prescribed training and pass the same
              successfully. In the event of failure, he may be given a second
              chance without stipend. If he fails again, he will be governed by
              the conditions stipulated in the Offer of Appointment.
              <br />
              <br />
              He will be responsible for Government money, stores, and any other
              property entrusted to him in the discharge of official duties. No
              change of category will be permitted for a minimum period of three
              years unless he is declared medically unsuitable for the category.
              <br />
              <br />
              His service will be terminable by one month’s notice on either
              side or by payment of one month’s salary, including allowances, in
              lieu of the notice (except in cases of removal or dismissal for
              misconduct). It will, however, be open to the Government to
              recover from him the salary for the period by which the notice
              falls short of one month. Similarly, if he wishes to resign, he
              may do so by depositing salary in lieu of notice for the period of
              shortfall. Such notice of resignation should be addressed to the
              competent authority.
              <br />
              <br />
              In cases of misconduct, he will be entitled to a reasonable
              opportunity to show cause why his services should not be
              terminated. In such cases, the condition of one month’s notice
              will not apply. This provision will also not apply if the services
              are dispensed with during the probation period.
