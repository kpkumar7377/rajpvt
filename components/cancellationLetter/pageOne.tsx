            Reference is invited to your application bearing Application No.{" "}

          <br />

          <p>
            Based on the recommendation of the Railway Recruitment Board and the
            subsequent verification of documents submitted by you, an offer of
            appointment was issued for the post of <b>{data.designation}</b>.
            However, during the process of detailed verification of certificates
            and records submitted by you, certain discrepancies have been
            noticed.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            After careful examination of the matter and verification of the
            records available with this office, it has been observed that the

            stipulated in the recruitment notification and the rules governing
            the appointment to the said post.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Accordingly, the competent authority has reviewed the case and it
            has been decided that the offer of appointment issued to you earlier
            for the post of <b>{data.designation}</b> cannot be sustained.

          <br />

            <b> cancelled with immediate effect</b>.

          <br />

          <p>The cancellation has been made on the following grounds:</p>

          <p className="font-semibold">{data.reason}</p>

            documentary evidence as per the recruitment rules.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
